# calculator-website
My 3-day project for learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
A simple static website that will host tools I find handy for uni classes.

Technologies used:
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- CloudFlare deployment tools

Credit to:
- Semantic UI
- The brain of my awesome full-stack eng. friend
- The networks lecturer that likes calculating IP addresses by hand, fueling my irritation into making this
